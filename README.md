# DogeCoin-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
This notebook focuses on cleaning historical data on stock prices of NVDA and SP500. The data was obtained from a public repository, and will then be used for predictive analysis using machine learning. The data was cleaned separately and then the cleaned version of each dataset was combined for the analysis.
The project itself is to create a predictive model based on historical data implementing machine learing techniques.

Skills demonstrated in this notebook are Python, Numpy, Pandas, and data cleaning.
